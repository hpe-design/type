# Type
We use three different typefaces to create communications, depending on the format and situation: Arial, MetricHPE and HPE Simple. Arial is our internal typeface. It is widely available and should be used for all internal and day-today communications. MetricHPE and HPE Simple typefaces should be used for external, designed communication. Please see the International Typefaces section for exceptions.

## HPE Metric

The weights and styles pictured here are approved for use in all external Hewlett Packard Enterprise communications. Use MetricHPE for headlines, subheads and main body copy in external printed and digital HPE communications wherever possible.

Partner agencies working on HPE projects can download the font here at no cost. Partner agencies are not allowed to distribute MetricHPE to subcontracted resources. Please have any subcontracted resources register for Brand Central to obtain the font directly from us.

## HPE Simple

HPE Simple is used for page numbers, numerical callouts and infographics. It can be used in copy that supports numerical callouts if the text is around ten words or less. It should not be used in titles, subtitles or body copy.

## Arial

Arial is our fallback typeface (also known as system typeface) for use with desktop applications and documents, such as PowerPoint, Microsoft Word and Outlook. Use Arial for day-to-day communications and when referncing HPE Metric is not possible.
